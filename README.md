update_desinfect
================

A small bash script to automagically update a desinfect image

The script is currently intended to be used for PXE boot. But you can easily
add a mkisofs command to the end of the script for creating a iso.
Patches welcome!

The script can be run from a daily cron job to supply your technicians with an
up to date Desinfect version to boot on client computers.

Please report bugs/feature requests via github.
